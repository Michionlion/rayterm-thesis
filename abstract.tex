\begin{abstract}
  Over the many years of innovation in the field of computer graphics, advances in rendering have led to massive increases in the fidelity of engaging, satisfying, and realistic computer visualizations.
  \name{} is a new and unique entry into the ranks of rendering engines, and makes its own contributions to the field of computer graphics.
  While harkening back to the retro aesthetics of the seventies and eighties, \name{} embraces new advances in computing power to bring fully ray-traced visuals to an old screen\,---\,the terminal.
  Using Unicode block characters to simulate pixels and a ray-tracer written in C++, \name{} renders a fully three-dimensional (3D) scene, complete with global illumination and physically-based materials.
  \name{} can be used as an engine for terminal-based 3D tools, visualizations, games, and more; it is fully open-source and ready for integration into other projects.
