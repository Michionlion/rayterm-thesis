\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}

In this chapter we discuss the implementation journey, and all the challenges and solutions we encountered.
Because much of the development effort for \name\ was focused on ray-tracing, many of the topics here are also related to ray-tracing.

\section{CPU Prototype}\label{ch:implementation:prototype}

The CPU research prototype was the most challenging component to implement.
This was likely because much of the research was difficult, and for every implementation effort afterwards, we were able to reference the prototype.
Some of the bigger challenges involved accurately replicating physical phenomenon, since the mathematics and physics behind them are often extremely complicated, and physics textbooks take a long time to read.
The below sections chronicle the implementation journey, with various figures at milestones along the way, illustrating what the \texttt{ppm} output looked like at the time.

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item metal bug
%   \item blender comparisons
%   \item space differential
%   \item coordinate systems
%   \item research difficulty (can't read a physics textbook for each material)
% \end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texttt{raymath}}\label{ch:implementation:prototype:raymath}

The \texttt{raymath} component was really straightforward to implement, and there are no significant challenges.
This was also an introduction to the Eigen library \cite{eigenweb}, and C++ in general.
One big decision made in \texttt{raymath} was to \texttt{typedef} certain Eigen template types to ensure that the rest of \texttt{rayterm-cpu} code used only types such as \texttt{vector} or \texttt{ray}, instead of the more complicated Eigen equivelents \texttt{Eigen::Matrix<scalar, 3, 1>} and \texttt{Eigen::ParametrizedLine<scalar, 3>}.
A \texttt{scalar} type was also defined, in theory for the purpose of changing from \texttt{double} to \texttt{float} calculations if desired.
However there are some dependencies in \texttt{raytrace} on \texttt{double} calculations, so changing that now is likely to introduce problems.

One of the only challenges in \texttt{raymath} implementation was dealing with memory alignment.
Any structure that uses Eigen structs needs to be correctly aligned, and the error messages for discovering this are not easily interpretable.
Thus, it was only after some research that the \texttt{EIGEN\_MAKE\_ALIGNED\_OPERATOR\_NEW} macro was discovered and put to use.
The \texttt{raymath} component is also one of the better tested modules, with tests to ensure the mathematics of intersection work for all situations.

\subsection{\texttt{raytrace}}\label{ch:implementation:prototype:raytrace}

The \texttt{raytrace} component had the most development time put into it throughout the entire \name\ development process.
It started off as an extremely simple Monte Carlo path-tracer, and graduated to increasingly more complex materials, algorithms, and implementations.
Here we will describe some of the steps through this process.

The first image output ever produced is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-cpu_ppm_output_first}.
This tested the \texttt{ppm} writing code, and not much else was implemented beyond that.
Next, sphere intersection was implemented as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-cpu_first_raytraced_image}.
This first ray-traced image was colored by showing the normal vector at the intersection point, shifted into the RGB color range; the $x$ component to the red component, the $y$ to the green, etc.
Finally the first iteration of \texttt{World} was implemented, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-cpu_first_multiobject_raytraced_image}.
Here, multiple spheres are able to be intersected, and each ray is tested against each object in the scene.
This uses the same normal visualization as before.

The next steps were to enable multiple samples per pixel.
Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-cpu_multisampling} shows some of the difficulties we encountered.
The biggest challenge here was ensuring that the ray direction was correct;
during this time \texttt{Camera} was rewritten into the final version, with much better robustness for situations like this.
In \texttt{rayterm-cpu} we use random subpixel jitter for every sample -- this was what caused the majority of the issues, and took some time to work out.

The first material development used a different scattering function than currently; the development sequence is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-cpu_lambert_development}.
In the beginning, Lambertian scatter was acheived through picking a random vector in a sphere, and offsetting that vector by the normal.
This provides a good approximation, but later versions replaced this with a non-uniform hemispherical sampling algorithm, which generates vector in the entire visible hemisphere centered on the normal from the intersection point.
There is an existing bug with this version, however: the sampling is not uniform.
There is a concentration around the normal vector due to the random sampling method we used.
This is fixed in \texttt{rayterm-gpu} -- you can see the difference in Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-gpu_hemispherical_sampling}.

Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-cpu_intersection_bug} was the first high-quality render attempted, and it actually revealed a subtle bug not seen before.
This render took 141 seconds, and had an spp of 1600.
The bug revealed is easily visible at the intersection between the small and large spheres -- there is a ``ledge'' or bright spot where it should be completely occluded.
This was a result of too high of a limit being placed on the scattered rays; rays that had an intersection less than $0.001$ were discarded.
However, these rays would have darkened the crevice between the two spheres.
They essentially bounced back and forth between the spheres, attenuating at each bounce, but were stopped too soon while the distance they traveled was still visible.
This was easily fixed by decreasing the limit to $0.00001$.

\end{figure}

Now that the ray-tracing basics were taken care of, we moved on to more diverse materials.
Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-cpu_metallic} is a test scene with various metallic or glossy materials, along with some Lambertian.
The only real difference between the two is that glossy materials have a bias towards the reflection direction when scattering rays.
That bias is controlled by the roughness -- the large sphere to the right has a very low roughness, while the closer small red sphere's roughness is slightly larger.
At lower values, the roughness controls the blurriness of reflections; at larger values, it controls how ``diffuse'' the object looks.
Again, in the first implementation the mathematics behind the scattering were similar to the Lambertian starting math, except instead of a sphere offset by the normal, the random vectors were generated in a sphere with radius equal to the roughness value, and offset by the normalized reflection direction.
This also provides an workable approximation, however was soon replaced, just as the Lambertian math was.
The replacement is actually considerably better; we sample a hemisphere centered on the normal, and then linearly interpolate the reflection direction towards that random vector based on the roughness.
Thus, a roughness of one causes metallic materials to be mathematically identical to Lambertian.
This method is discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{ch:methods:renderer:sequential:algorithms}.

  \caption{Metallic materials}
  \label{fig:rayterm-cpu_metallic}
\end{figure}

Next on the list of material types to implement were dielectrics.
These cover a wide range of object looks, all involving both reflection and refraction; common examples are water and glass.
The development cycle along with some problems encountered are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-cpu_dielectric_development}.
One huge issue was that once reflection and refraction were working correctly, we discovered a bug in metallic materials that would appear whenever we corrected glass bugs.
This turned out to have been caused by the poor approximation in the metallic scatter function, but it took a significant amount of effort to find that.
This bug is discussed more later on.

  \label{fig:rayterm-cpu_dielectric_development}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:rayterm-cpu_t_intersection_bug} shows a bug that appeared after first implementing dielectrics, where metals with a high roughness value were seemingly not shading correctly.
Another manifestation was found where glass materials did not correctly internally refract/reflect.
This bug was solved by adding tests to check for internal intersection capability, since that was a likely suspect.
That turned out to be the issue; we then added implementation to pass those tests by searching for the smallest non-negative $t$ when testing intersections.
Before this change, the $t$ found for intersections was always the result of $\frac{-b - \sqrt{discriminant}}{2a}$; now we consider $\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{discriminant}}{2a}$.
This bug fix also exposed the metallic material halo bug, which we talk about next.

  \label{fig:rayterm-cpu_t_intersection_bug}
\end{figure}

The most challenging and complicated bug we encountered during \texttt{rayterm-cpu} development was the metal halo bug.
It manifested as a halo of lighter color around the edges of metallic spheres with high roughness values.
This turned out to have been caused by the old sphere mathematics in the metallic scatter function.
It manifested the way it did because when roughness values were high, the generated rays sometimes intersected the surface of the sphere and were not discarded; instead, the lighter color that was not visible to the camera leaked over the edges.
This was a fascinating bug to tackle, and resulted in a lot of learning experiences.
We additionally did the first comparison test between a Blender \cite{blender} scene and our own.
This test showed that once the solution was implemented, our metallic material is very similar to Blender's.
We also learned from this comparison that the dielectric material is not quite physically accurate -- notice that there is a darker edge around the glass ball in the Blender reference image, which is much smaller in the \texttt{rayterm-cpu} generated image.
This could be caused by offsets in Blender's ray-tracing or inaccuracies in the refraction mathematics, however it is probably the Schlick approximation \cite{schlick1994inexpensive} that is to blame.
